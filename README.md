## Batalleo Starter

---

This is just a template project with a few things that I have been using on a sideproject called Batalleo.

I would rather start with these as basics than just going from scratch when I'm creating something using Next, which I'm really fond of right now.

- **base**: react, nextjs, typescript.
- **component library**: chakra-ui.
- **testing**: jest.
- **updating deps**: updtr.
- **linting & more**: eslint (airbnb's config), prettier, lint-staged, husky.

Shoutout to my friend **@antosan** for being so inspiring.
